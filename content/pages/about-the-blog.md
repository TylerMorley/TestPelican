Welcome to Sound and Narrative! This is a place where I'll talk about music and stories that I love and why I think they are so great. Each post will be a little bit of a discussion on craft, and a little bit of a starry-eyed review.

My plan is to put out a new post every two weeks, and I plan to stick with it.
